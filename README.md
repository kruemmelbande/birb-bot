This bot is intended as a personal project. While I am making it publicly available, and you are free to use it,  
i give absolutely no guarantee about this setup working for you, or future updates intruducing unwanted behaviour.

# Looking for a future maintainer  
if you are willing and able to maintain this project, please hit me up through discord, an issue, or an email.
If i do not find a maintainer by the end of the year, then i will probably not be able to keep hosting this bot.
